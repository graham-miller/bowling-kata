# Bowling Kata

Write code that will calculate the total score for a game of ten-pin bowling.

To keep it simple, the code does not have to:

* Check the validity of the rolls.

* Check for the correct number of rolls and frames.

* Calculate scores for intermediate frames.

## Scoring

A game of bowling is made up of ten frames. In each frame the player has two chances to knock down ten pins with the roll of a ball.

If all ten pins are knocked down after the first roll a strike (X) is awarded and the frame is complete.

If all ten pins are knocked down after the second roll a spare (/) is awarded.

One point is scored for each pin knocked down and additionally:

* If a strike is awarded the player receives a bonus equal to the number of pins knocked down on their next two rolls.

* If a spare is awarded the player receives a bonus equal to the number of pins knocked down on their next roll.

In the final frame:

* If a strike is awarded, the player will roll two further times to determine their strike bonus.

* If a spare is awarded, the player will roll one further time to determine their spare bonus.
